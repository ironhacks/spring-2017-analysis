## Effects of training and gender on the memory test performance

> We want to answer the following questions:
1. At the population level, are there any difference in novelty score phase 5 for the 4
 groups?
2. At the population level, are there any difference in novelty score phase 5 for lines of codes added? 
3. Do the effects of groups on the novelty score phase 5 differ across the number of lines of codes added? 

```{r}
model<-lm(novelty.phase5~factor(Group)*factor(sum.add.loc), data=scores_loc)
anova(model)
```
> Main effect of group
From the output, the F-statistic for testing the main effect of group is 1.5070.
Based on the F distribution with degrees of freedom 3 and 49, the corresponding p-value is
0.22439, which indicates no significant main effect for group. Therefore, one may
conclude there is no significant difference in novelty score phase 5 among the four groups.

> Main effect of lines of codes added
From the output, the F-statistic for testing the main effect of sex is 1.6224. Based on the
F distribution with degrees of freedom 85 and 49, the corresponding p-value is 0.03367,
which indicates a significant main effect on sum.add.loc. Therefore, one may conclude there is a significant
difference in novelty score phase 5 betwen the number of lines of codes added. 

> Interaction effect between training group and sex
From the output, the F-statistic for testing the interaction effect [factor(Group):factor(sum.add.loc)]
is 0.9762. Based on the F distribution with degrees of freedom 25 and 49, the corresponding
p-value is 0.51242, which indicates an insignificant interaction effect. Therefore, one may
conclude the difference in novelty score phase 5 among the group does not
depend on lines of codes added. 

## Investigating the novelty score phase 5 across 4 groups. 

```{r}
library(Rmisc)
library(ggplot2)
stats <- summarySE(scores_loc, measurevar="novelty.phase5", groupvars=c("Group"))
stats
```

> Highest mean is full transparency group, followed by performance transparency, followed by solution transparency and followed by no transparency. 

## Investigating the user requirement score phase 5 across 4 groups. 


```{r}
library(Rmisc)
library(ggplot2)
stats <- summarySE(scores_loc, measurevar="user.requirement.phase5", groupvars=c("Group"))
stats
```

> Highest mean is full transparency group, followed by performance transparency, followed by solution transparency and followed by no transparency. 


```{r}
library(Rmisc)
library(ggplot2)
stats <- summarySE(scores_loc, measurevar="tech.phase5", groupvars=c("Group"))
stats
```
```{r}
library(Rmisc)
library(ggplot2)
stats <- summarySE(scores_loc, measurevar="infovis.phase5", groupvars=c("Group"))
stats
```


## Investigating the total lines of codes added BETWEEN phase 1 and phase 5 across 4 groups.


```{r}
library(Rmisc)
library(ggplot2)
stats <- summarySE(scores_loc, measurevar="sum.add.loc", groupvars=c("Group"))
stats
```

> Highest mean is full transparency group, followed by performance transparency, followed by solution transparency and followed by no transparency. 


## Independent two-sample t-test on novelty score phase 5 and user requirment score phase 5

> The independent samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically
distributed samples are obtained, one from each of the two populations being compared. For
example, in evaluating the effect of an intervention, we enroll 100 participants and randomly
assign 50 to the treatment group and the other 50 to the control group. In this case, we have
two independent samples and should use the independent two-sample t-test.

>  Welch’s t test (unpooled two independent sample t test)
When the two population variances of the two groups are not equal (the two sample sizes
may or may not be equal).

> In R, the function t.test() can be used to conduct a t test. The following code conducts the
Welch’s t test. Note that alternative = "greater" sets the alternative hypothesis. The
other options include two.sided and less.

>> Comment - more reliable when the two samples have unequal variances and/or unequal sample sizes


```{r}
var(scores_loc$novelty.phase5[scores_loc$Group==0])
```

```{r}
var(scores_loc$novelty.phase5[scores_loc$Group==3])
```

# Interpretation:

> Variance is different so we use  Welch’s t test

```{r}
