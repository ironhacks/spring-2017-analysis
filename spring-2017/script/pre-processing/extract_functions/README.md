## About Functional Extractions

A functional feature extraction method is proposed and implemented. In Javascript, the format of calling function is the object variable name + '.' + the function name. So regular expression is used to match the string in this pattern in the code.

### Blacklisted Functions

function_filter.csv: used to remove the string in the same format as the calling function

library_list.csv: used to remove the libraries used in the project
