This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
scores_loc <- read.table("/Users/jialincheoh/Downloads/overall_score_click_result.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
scores_loc
```
```{r}
scores_novelty <- scores_loc[, c('Group', 'novelty.phase5')]
scores_novelty                         
```
```{r}
library(onewaytests)
charac <- as.character(scores_novelty$Group)
bf.test(novelty.phase5 ~ charac, scores_novelty)
```


```{r}
lmnovelty <- lm(novelty.phase5 ~ Group, scores_novelty)
plot(lmnovelty)
```
```{r}
lmtest::bptest(lmnovelty)  
```

```{r}
car::ncvTest(lmnovelty)  
```

```{r}
# Not normal which is a BIG problem
shapiro.test(residuals(lmnovelty))
```

## Assumptions. Student's t-test assumes that the population parameter being compared for two populations is normally distributed, and that the populations have equal variances. Welch's t-test is designed for unequal population variances, but the assumption of normality is maintained.


```{r}
library(boxcoxfr)
# to apply Box-Cox transformation (AID)
out <- boxcoxfr(scores_novelty$length, scores_novelty$Group)
```
