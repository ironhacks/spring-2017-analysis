This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) for the clicks analysis of Spring 2017. We fit a linear regression model with the number of clicks as the predictor and novelty score / user requirement score as the outcome variable. 

## Notes 

> Significant tests show if a linear relationship exists but not the strength of the relationship. The coefficient of determination, R2, is a descriptive measure of the strength of the
regression relationship, a measure on how well the regression line fits the data. In general the
higher the value of R2, the better the model fits the data.
• R2 = 1: Perfect match between the line and the data points.
• R2 = 0: There are no linear relationship between x and y.
R2
is an effect size measure. Cohen (1988) defined some standards for interpreting R2
.
• R2 = .01: Small effect
• R2 = .06: Medium effect
• R2 = .15: Large effect.

```{r}
scores_loc <- read.table("/Users/jialincheoh/Downloads/overall_score_click_result.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
scores_loc
```

## Subsetting for Bogota 3, Bogota 2 and Bogota 1

```{r}
bogota_3 <- subset(scores_loc, Group == 3)
bogota_3
```
```{r}
bogota_2 <- subset(scores_loc, Group == 2)
bogota_2
```

```{r}
bogota_1 <- subset(scores_loc, Group == 1)
bogota_1
```
## Bogota 3

## Regression Model with Total Clicks Count in Bogota 3 as Predictor and User Requirement Score in Phase 5 as Outcome Variable

```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_3$user.requirement.phase5~bogota_3$sum.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Significant ( 0.00478 ** ) which means a linear relationship exists between the total clicks count in bogota 3 and the user requirement score in phase 5 for bogota 3
> 0.1868 ( large effect ) based on Cohen (1988)


```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_3$novelty.phase5~bogota_3$sum.clicks.count))
```

## Interpretation: 

> Significant ( 0.00629 **  ) which means a linear relationship exists between the total clicks count in bogota 3 and the novelty score in phase 5 for bogota 3
> 0.1762 ( large effect ) based on Cohen (1988)


```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_3$user.requirement.phase5~bogota_3$project.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Not significant ( 0.0997 )

```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_3$user.requirement.phase5~bogota_3$score.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Significant ( 0.0125 *   ) which means a linear relationship exists between the score clicks count in bogota 3 and the user requirement score in phase 5 for bogota 3
> 0.1655 ( large effect ) based on Cohen (1988)

# Bogota 2


```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_2$novelty.phase5~bogota_2$sum.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Not significant ( 0.243 )


```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_2$user.requirement.phase5~bogota_2$sum.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Not significant ( 0.160655 )

# Bogota 1

```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_1$novelty.phase5~bogota_1$sum.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Significant ( 0.00559 ** ) which means a linear relationship exists between the total clicks count in bogota 1 and the novelty score in phase 5 for bogota 1
> 0.1851 ( large effect ) based on Cohen (1988)


```{r}
summary(lm(bogota_1$user.requirement.phase5~bogota_1$sum.clicks.count))
```
## Interpretation: 

> Significant (5.79e-05 *** ) which means a linear relationship exists between the total clicks count in bogota 1 and the user requirment score in phase 5 for bogota 1
> 0.3501 ( large effect ) based on Cohen (1988)
