## Interpretation

> An ANOVA revealed that there was a significant effect of treatment on improve-tech-15 (F(1, 163) = 4.4915, p < 0.03561) while controlling for aspiration. Further investigation of the impact of professorsâ€™ ranks on their salaries using planned contrasts revealed that having any sort of solution transparency (solution transparency or full transparency) was associated with a significant increase in improve-tech-15 compared to having no transparency at all or having just performance transparency, t(163) = 2.391, p < 0.018 (two-tailed), but there is no significant difference between solution transparency and full transparency on improve-tech-15.
