- run ANOVA on subscores ->  improve-tech-15, improve-ur-15, improve-novelty-15, improve-vis-15

- 

- Perform Cronbach alpha on improve-total-15

- Find a better compound measure than improve-total-15 using PCA

with improve-tech-15, improve-ur-15, improve-vis-15, improve-novelty-15

## Steps of Performing PCA 

- Check assumptions of PCA

- Use Varimax Rotation

- Report unrotated factors

(a) Overall sample  

(b) Subsample sample   

- Think about how the re-coding of the treatment variable transparency would affect how we perform the ANOVA
